					***************************
					
					Changes in MPTinR Version 0.1.0
					Released October 2011

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o	MPTinR is now based on S4 classes and methods. There exists visible classes for
		models (bmpt.model and mpt.model) and the results (bmpt and mpt), furthermore 
		invisible classes for the restrictions.

	o	fit.mpt() remains to be the main function that can (when called with a 
		model.filename as the model argument) create a model file (via a call to
		make.model()). Based on which type of model, either a member of L-BMPT 
		(Purdy & Batchelder, 2009) or not, a method for fitting is selected
		(dispatched). Most new features require models being member of L-BMPT.
		
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	generate.data(): A function to generate random or predicted data from either 
		a model and paramters (using a .model object) or a fitted model (bmpt or mpt object).

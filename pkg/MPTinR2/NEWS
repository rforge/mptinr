					Released December 2011

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o	make.mpt() is now a generic and allows to specify the model via a file
		(as before) or a connection (i.e., you can specify the model in your R script).
		See the examples in make.mpt()
		
	o	Similarly, you can specify the restrictions via a restrictions file or connection 
		or as a list of characters (see also the examples).

	o	Comments should now be handled as in other programs. Everything right to a # will
		be skipped (and NOT the whole line).
		
	o	All these changes to make.mpt follow input from Meik Michalke (University of Düssedorf)
		
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	Should give an error if a constant (in a restriction) is outside [0,1].

	Significant User Visible Changes
	
	o	MPTinR is now based on S4 classes and methods. There exists visible classes for
		models (bmpt.model and mpt.model) and the results (bmpt and mpt), furthermore 
		invisible classes for the restrictions.

	o	fit.mpt() remains to be the main function that can (when called with a 
		model.filename as the model argument) create a model file (via a call to
		make.model()). Based on which type of model, either a member of L-BMPT 
		(Purdy & Batchelder, 2009) or not, a method for fitting is selected
		(dispatched). Most new features require models being member of L-BMPT.
		
	
	New Features / Bugfixes
	
	o	generate.data(): A function to generate random or predicted data from either 
		a model and paramters (using a .model object) or a fitted model (bmpt or mpt object).

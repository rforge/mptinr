Author: Henrik Singmann, David Kellen, and Karl Christoph Klauer
Maintainer: Henrik Singmann <henrik.singmann@psychologie.uni-freiburg.de>
Description: This is a completely new version of a package for the analysis of multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (e.g.,  Riefer, D. M., and Batchelder, W. H. [1988]. Multinomial modeling and the measurement of cognitive processes. Psychological Review, 95, 318-339) for individual and multi-individual data. This version is based on formal S4 classes and methods and contains a EM fitting algorithm written in Fortran. However, this version is still under heavy development, but the fitting is already functional and a lot faster. See ?fit.mpt and ?make.mpt for more details.

		* fixed but in fit.model()'s lower and upper.bound arguments. Now works

2012-01-12
		* changed .find.mpt.params to rely on all.vars()
		* adapted fit.mpt() (creating parameters from inequality restrictions) to 
		  deal with the new .find.mpt.params() function (i.e., inequalities are 
		  parse()d prior to calling .find.mpt.params).
		* added fit.model(), a copy of fit.mpt() with parameter bounds as an argument

		* R/fit.mpt.R: now starting value parameter works
		* Small bug removed when fitting one row from a data.frame (now, does not set multiFit to TRUE)

		* R/fit.mpt.R: fixed crashing when hessian of aggregated data was ill defined

2011-06-28

		* R/fit.mpt.R: added starting.values parameter.
		* R/fit.mpt.Rd: added description for the starting.values parameter.
		* R/fit.mpt.R: internal changes: replaced length.tree with n.params.

		* R/bmpt.fia.R: if theta is a scalar, it now is a matrix.

VERSION 0.6.3

o get.mpt.fia modified such that bmpt.fia is only called as often as there are differences in the hank.join parameters (i.e., only if the ratio between the trees differ, not the ns). As a consequence, CFIA is calculated as part of get.mpt.fia. Furthermore, CIs of CFIA are not returned by get.mpt.fia.

o fit.mpt adjusted to use the optimization of get.mpt.fia (see above) for multi-individual fit. That is, fit.mpt now calls get.mpt.fia only once (previous were two calls, one for for individual data, one for aggregated data).

o bmpt.fia fixed to deal with models without restricted parameters (was necessary as R does not have an empty matrix, in contrast to Matlab)

o objective function in fit.mpt vectorized (previous was using for-loop). Obtained speed up: ~40%.

o Corrected a bug that lead to a wrong labeling of restricted parameters in the mean parameter table for multi-individual fit when using sort.param = TRUE.

o Corrected a bug in the R implementation of bmpt.fia, when only one parameter was fixed.
